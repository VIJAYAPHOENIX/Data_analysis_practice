Power View - Visualizations

What and why is visualization?
--> Easy understanding of data.
--> Faster insights.
--> Engage with Filters to deep dive into data faster.
--> Effective Communication.

Categorical data / Discrete data
--> It can be countable without a decimal point.
--> E.g.: Market, segment, Gender, Quantity etc..

Numerical data / Continuous data / Series of data
--> It contains decimal values.
--> E.g. sales, speed etc..

---------------------------------------------------------
Visuals
---------------------------------------------------------
Categorical data - Done

Pie Chart -- 1 Categorical column , 1 numerical column, <= 7 distinct value or groups
Donut chart -- 1 Categorical column , 1 numerical column, <= 10 distinct value or groups
Tree map -- 1 Categorical column , 1 numerical column, <= 15 - 20 distinct value or groups

>Below Chart are come to picture when we have 20 groups and 1 numeric, 2 categorical columns.
-- Horizontal display is bars.
-- Vertical display is columns.

Stacked Bar Chart & Stacked Column Chart --> Displays individual sub groups in the same bar by summarization.
100% Stacked Bar Chart & 100% Stacked Column Chart --> Displays individual sub groups in the same bar by calculating the percentage.
Clustered Bar Chart & Clustered Column Chart --> Displays each sub groups in a group as a cluster together.

---------------------------------------------------------
Continuous data / Series data - Done

Line Chart --> 2 categorical, 1 numerical columns is take for better visual.
Ribbon Chart --> 2 categorical, 1 numerical columns is take for better visual.
Area Chart --> 2 categorical, 1 numerical columns is take for better visual. But it shows values individually unlike stacked charts.
Stacked Area Chart --> 2 categorical, 1 numerical columns is take for better visual. But it shows values stacked in a manner.
Line and Stacked Column Chart --> 2 categorical, 2 numerical columns is take for better visual. But it shows values stacked.
Line and Clustered Column Chart --> 2 categorical, 1 numerical columns is take for better visual. But it shows values individually unlike stacked charts.
Scatter Chart --> --> 2 categorical, 1 numerical columns is take for better visual. It is like x,y graphs from school.

---------------------------------------------------------
Filter and Slicers - Done

Slicers --> This is used by the viewer/client/end-user who uses the report.

Date and Time - Vertical, List, Tile, Dropdown, Between, Relative date, Relative Time.
Text Slicer - Vertical, List, Tile, Dropdown.
Numeric Slicer - Vertical, List, Tile, Dropdown, Between, Greater than equal to, Less than equal to.

Filters -- It is used by the developer in order to restrict the data.

Filter on visual.
Filter on page.
Filter on all pages.

---------------------------------------------------------
Other Visuals

Maps (Map, Filled Map, Shape Map) - Done
Card, Multicard - Done
Table, Matrix - Done
Waterfall Chart - Done
Funnel Chart - Done
Q & A - Done
KPI (Key Performance Indicator) - Done
Guage
R / Python - Done
Key Influencers --> explains the correlations for a metric of a dataset - Done
Decomposition Tree - Done
Smart Narrative

---------------------------------------------------
Hierarchy - Done
Drill Reports(Options) -- > Help to drill the same report to the next levels in the same visual.
Drill Down -->  Activate the drill down options.
Drill Up --> Helps to come back to the previous level in the hierarchy.
Go to the next level in the hierarchy - It takes to the next level by summation.
	For Example : If i ask to go to next level from year to quarter this will display 4 quarters for 
all the years.
		Sum of quarter 1 for all the years in the date.
Expand all down one level in the hierarchy - Drill down the report to the next level for all different years. 

Drill Through - Done
-->This will drill the data frompage one to another page.
--> Cross Report activation.
--> Drill Field.
--------------------------------------------------
Tolltip - Done
1. Select a new page --> Select canvas settings --> select the tooltip for the size of page.
2. Design the tooltip.
3. Select the visual --> select tooltip --> Select the page u designed in the dropdown.
--------------------------------------------------
Button, Shapes, Textbox, Images - DONE
--------------------------------------------------
Selection & Bookmarks
--> create a Report.
--> Add button/Shapes/Images.
--> Select view tab --> Select selection & Bookmarks.
--> Select the button then Select the appropriate visuals in the selection pane then click on bookmark and name it.
--> Select each button and give the action as a appropriate bookmark.
-------------------------------------------------
Sync Slicers - Done
-->To work on sync slicer the first thing is should use same column or field.
-->We can hid the slicer.
-->We can sync and unsync the slicers.
-------------------------------------------------
Performance Analyser --> It is used to analyze time is taken to each and everything to display the visuals. - Done
Edit Interactions
--> It is used to restrict the visuals to interact.
--> Power view/ Report View --> Format --> Edit interactions.
--> Circle button to remove the interaction.
--> Filter button to back to the interactions.
