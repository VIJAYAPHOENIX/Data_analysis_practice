Data modelling

Power Pivot vs PQE

PQE ---> ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), M-Language(mashup), Transformations.
Power Pivot ---> DAX(Data Analytics/Analysis Expressions), Transformations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between Inmemory Columnar database and traditional datadases,

Traditional databases /RDBMS
Eg: MYSQL, SQL Server, Oracle Etc.
-> Data is stored in row format.
-> Data is stored in disk and accessed from the list.
-> Data is not compressed and using more space.

InMemory Columnar database
-> When we create the reports on InMemory Columnar database, Performance is good when compared to RDBMS.
-> Data is stored in RAM and accessed from RAM.
-> Data is stored in column format.
-> Data is highly compressed.

Vertipaq Engine/ Xvelocity Engine
-> This is internally available in power pivot.
-> During the time of loading data from PQE to power BI Desktop this engine comes into picture.
-> This will reduce the size of data to the 1/10th of the original size of data.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Power BI Licenses 

capacity of data by various licenses are :
pro -> 1GB
premium -> 10GB 

If we work on a larger datasets like 100GB datasets then it will be a burden for both user and power to import the data,
So then the connecting models come to picture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Connecting Models

Import  --> Data present in power BI
Direct Query --> For larger datasets --> This has the information of columns and tables.(scheduled refresh)
Live --> Large datasets --> It is also contain the information of columns and tables.(Continuous refresh)


MSBI and Cloud

PQE (ETL) --> SSIS --> Data Bricks.
Power Pivot & Data Modelling --> SSAS.
Power View --> Power BI/Tableau.
To store the models --> Azure Analysis service or SSMS.
Pipeline --> Azure Data Factory.
Publish the reports --> SSRS, PBI Service.

Process:
	Large data -> Direct Query -> Alternate solution is SSAS.
	Large data -> SSAS --> To store models(SSMS/AAS) -->Direct Query --> PBI

--------------------------------------------------------------------
What is data modelling?
--> When ever you have a multiple tables to create visuals we use this modelling techniques.

What is relationship and types of relationships.
--> It is a connection or common link between to or more tables. Have a common column present in all.

Types of relationships/ cardinality
One - One
One - Many
Many - One
Many - Many

How do we establish a new relationship?
Edit Relationship.
Delete relationship.
Auto relationship.
File --> Option & Settings --> Options --> Current File --> Data load --> Checkbox(Auto detect relationship when data is loaded).
--> Either column name must be same.
--> Datatype of column name must be same.
  
--------------------------------------------------------
Cross Filter Direction
--> It is direction of the relationship between two tables.

--------------------------------------------------------
Assume Referential Integrity
-->* This will only work on Direct Query Tables.
--> It will work if the from tables has no null or empty values.
--> Each record from the tables must have a match in to table.
-->* the join performed is inner join.

--------------------------------------------------------
Schema/Models in Power BI

Dimensional column
--> It can be known for the distinct columns or fields.
--> It has the columns that has details of a column or fields.
--> Eg: Market, Country, City, Names etc..

Fact column
--> It contain the columns which can perform aggregate funtions
--> Eg: Sales, Profit, Quantity etc..

Dimension Table
--> It contains a primary key and dimensional columns.

Fact Table
--> It contains a Foreign key and fact columns.

What is schema/Model?
--> Dimensional tables and Fact tables combine is schema.

Types of Schemas
Star schema
--> In this schema multiple dimensional tables connect to a fact table through primary and foreign keys.
advantages
-> Simple
-> Performance is faster
-> Flexible
---------------------------------------------------------
Snowflake Schema
--> It is an extension of a star schema.
--> It consists of fact table and dimensional tables which are interlinked with multiple dimension tables.
Features
-> Normalization of data
-> Complex
-> Data Integrity
--------------------------------------------------------
Galaxy Schema
--> It is a combination of two or more star schemas.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Which schema is better to improve the performance of Power BI dashboard? - Star Schema
**Which schema works faster? - Star Schema
**Join performed i Power BI is -- Outer join
**How many relationships can be established between two tables? - More than one
**How many active relationships can be established between two tables? - One

PQE -- 10%
Data Modelling -- 40%
Power Pivot -- 30%
Power view -- 5%
Power BI service -- 15%
